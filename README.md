## About the Project  
This project addresses one of the most critical challenges in the telecom industry: customer churn. By developing a predictive model to identify customers most at risk of leaving, 
the analysis provides actionable insights for retention strategies, cost reduction, and revenue growth. It demonstrates how data engineering and machine learning can directly
influence business outcomes in highly competitive markets.

## Project Story  
When I began this project, I wanted to solve a problem that every telecom company fears: churn. It’s not just a percentage on a dashboard it’s lost trust, lost loyalty, and lost revenue.  

Reder Telecom was struggling. Competitors were offering similar services at aggressive prices, customer preferences were shifting toward personalized experiences, and network performance issues were eroding satisfaction. Retaining customers was becoming harder than ever.  

I set out to build a predictive model that could flag customers at risk of leaving. The journey wasn’t easy. The data was messy, features were complex, and balancing the dataset required persistence. But those challenges were exactly what made the project meaningful.  

Using Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn, I built an end-to-end pipeline:  
- Explored and cleaned historical customer data  
- Engineered features that captured customer behavior and loyalty signals  
- Trained and evaluated models with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC  
- Translated outputs into actionable insights for retention strategies

## Key Findings  
The most important features that correlated with churn were:  
- The number of service interactions through calls, emails, and chats  
- The frequency of recent payments  
- The time customers spent on the company’s website  
- The Net Promoter Score (NPS)  

These findings told a powerful story. Churn wasn’t just about competition, it was about the everyday experiences customers had with the company. By acting on these signals, Reder Telecom could reduce acquisition costs, grow revenue, and improve satisfaction.

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## Lessons Learned  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering are as critical as the model itself  
- Business context matters models must translate into strategies that teams can act on  
- Valid conclusions come from persistence through the struggles of cleaning, balancing, and testing

## Why This Matters  
Customer churn is more than a metric. It’s a reflection of customer trust. Predicting it accurately gives businesses the chance to intervene early, protect revenue, and build loyalty.

## Career Fit  
This project reflects the skills and mindset I bring to data engineering and analytics roles. I don’t just build models. I connect them to business outcomes. I’ve shown the ability to:  
- Work end-to-end, from raw data collection to actionable insights  
- Translate technical outputs into strategies that marketing and operations teams can act on  
- Balance technical rigor with business storytelling, making data accessible to non-technical stakeholders  
- Persist through challenges like messy datasets, feature complexity, and model trade-offs to arrive at valid conclusions  

I am actively seeking opportunities in the UK and beyond where I can apply these skills to real-world problems, with visa sponsorship. 
My goal is to help organizations leverage data to drive digital transformation, protect revenue, and build stronger customer relationships.
